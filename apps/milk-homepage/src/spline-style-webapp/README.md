## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd spline-style-webapp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application locally:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

- The main homepage will display 3D elements rendered by the `ThreeDScene` component.
- You can modify the 3D designs by editing the `ThreeDScene.jsx` file located in the `src/components` directory.
- Styles can be adjusted in the `main.css` file found in the `src/styles` directory.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to a dedicated server, build the project using:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then, upload the contents of the `build` directory to your server. Ensure that your server is configured to serve static files correctly.
